Producer-Consumer Pattern
-Producer(s)
 +Add elements to shared data structure
-Consumer(s)
 +Remove elements from shared data structure


First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
-Items are removed in the same order that they're added to the queue
-First item added will be the first item removed

Synchronization Challenges:
-Enforce mutual exclusion of producers and consumers
-Prevent producers from trying to add data to a full queue
-Prevent consumers from trying to remove data from an empty queue


Average rate of production              <              Average rate of consumption
Average rate of production              <              Average rate of consumption
Average rate of production              <              Average rate of consumption
