Semaphore:

-Synchronization mechanism
-Can be used by multiple threads at the same time
-Includes a counter to track availability

acquire()
-If counter is positive, decrement counter
-If counter is zero, wait until available

release()
-Increment counter
-Signal waiting thread

Counting Semaphore:
-Value ≥ 0
-Used to track limited resources
 +Pool of connections

Binary Semaphore:
-Value = 1 or 0
 +O represents locked
 +1 represents unlocked
-Used similar to mutex by acquiring/releasing

Mutex vs. Semaphore:
Mutex:
-Can only be acquired/released by the same thread
Semaphore:
-Can be acquired/released by different threads
