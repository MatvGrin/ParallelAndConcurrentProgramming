CountDownLatch:

CountDownLatch(value) – Initialize count value
await() - Wait for count value to reach zero
countDown () - Decrement count value

CyclicBarrier                                            |          CountDownLatch
Releases when certain number of threads are waiting      |          Releases when count value reaches zero
Can be reset                                             |          Cannot be reset

Common CountDownLatch Usage
• Initialize count to 1
 + A simple on/off gate
• Initialize count to N
 + Wait for N threads to complete some action
 + Wait for some action to complete N times
